# Biomolecular Simulation Setup Paper

## Goals
* Produce a brief checklist of most critical and most overlooked items that practitioners can follow and potentially reviewers can use.
* Highlight issues where further study (or references we don’t know about yet) are needed to clarify what should be done; solicit input from the community on how best to handle issues
* Guideline on how to report the checklist addressed items in a publication: Note that typical methods sections should provide the information in this checklist. 

## Scope
* Relatively simple biomolecular simulations that may include small molecule ligands
    * May not be able to include nucleic acid recommendations initially because of lack of expertise, but Toni can cover lipid
    * Eventually to include cofactors as part of the consideration
* Does NOT include:
    * Generation of parameters, such as for nonstandard nonstandard residues (as opposed to standard nonstandard residues where literature and/or library parameters may already be available), or for complicated lipids or cofactors… AND these will be coupled to force field choice to some extent.
    * Simulation protocol such as minimization, cutoffs, etc.

## Paper writing as code development
<!-- This discussion is so that people know how to contribute to your document. -->
This paper is being developed as a living document, open to changes from the community.
You can read more about the concept of writing a paper in the same way one would write software code in the essay ["Paper writing as code development"](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/paper_code.html).
If you have comments or suggestions, we welcome them! Please [submit them as issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to this GitHub repository so they can be recorded and given credit for the contribution.
Specific changes can be proposed [via pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
