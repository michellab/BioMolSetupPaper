# BioMolSetupPaper

## Goals
* Produce a brief checklist of most critical and most overlooked items that practitioners can follow and potentially reviewers can use.
* Highlight issues where further study (or references we don’t know about yet) are needed to clarify what should be done; solicit input from the community on how best to handle issues
* Guideline on how to report the checklist addressed items in a publication: Note that typical methods sections should provide the information in this checklist. 

## Scope
* Relatively simple biomolecular simulations that may include small molecule ligands
    * May not be able to include nucleic acid recommendations initially because of lack of expertise, but Toni can cover lipid
    * Eventually to include cofactors as part of the consideration
* Does NOT include:
    * Generation of parameters, such as for nonstandard nonstandard residues (as opposed to standard nonstandard residues where literature and/or library parameters may already be available), or for complicated lipids or cofactors… AND these will be coupled to force field choice to some extent.
    * Simulation protocol such as minimization, cutoffs, etc.
